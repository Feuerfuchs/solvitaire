## TODO

### P1
### P2
 * TODO: undo:
	 - insert append_undo() in x2y() functions
	 - to encode stack position we need to overload `f.u.n` as index.
	   (similar for foundation: overload `f.u.n` as foundation id)
	 - w2f(): have to encode both stock index and foundation id <-XXX
	          don't want to add a struct field for this one case; 
	          for the time being (i.e. forever) I'm ORing waste index and
	          (foundation id<<16). ugly but works :/
	 - turning over cards: this needs to be encoded, because the card might 
	   be consecutive and there's no way to tell what its previous state was. 
	   at least 3 methods possible:
	    * indicate that a card was turned (can be at most 1) by negating u.n
	      pros: no wasted space (it's just a boolean value), negation pattern 
	            already used for closed cards
	      cons: dirty C hack, less obvious than in other places, no need to
	            conserve memory this tightly
	    - another flag in f.u (.c for was-closed?)
	      pros: a little bit more obvious
	      cons: seems like a clutch to me, won't do anything in most cases
	    - two undo structures (where .f == .t for example; auto-apply both)
	      pros: no need to modify structures
	      cons: more burden on changing x2y(), need to check if we need to
	            execute two undos (or redos) at once everytime
	   will use the starred method (negating), because a) the code is
	   hackish aleady b) further cements the idea that .n is not just a
	   'number of cards' but an argument that changes form depending on the
	   context.  also, c) i don't like the other two options, because reasons.
 * TODO: cleanup: in `x2y()` functions there is a lot of replication and noise
         when calculating legal moves, top cards, etc. 
### P3
 * TODO: mouse mode
 * TODO: screen size > stack height => rendering issues!
 * TODO: suggest moves (`h` => hint)
### P4
 * TODO: scores, variants: draw 3, max. n overturns
 * TODO: vt220 mode (problems: charset, slow baudrate and no differential drawing mode)
 * TODO: ed(1) mode (solEDaire): playable on a line printer; ascii/ibm only?

### DONE
 * DONE: use `#ifdef`s to differentiate games (sol, spider, ed-sol, ed-spider)
 * DONE: keyboard alias: twice same key == waste/pile -> foundation
 * DONE: spider keyboard: `<from><to>` stacks; 1-9,0=tableu, return=draw
 * DONE: spider: easy/medium difficulty: only deal 1/2 suits instead of 4 -> deal()
 * DONE: patience: allow taking from 0(foundation)
 * DONE: highlight `from` pile, so users can see at what input stage they are
 * DONE: make piles 0-indexed in klondike as well
 * HOLD: duplicate card â™ A found in tableu: added check at start to monitor this
         Cannot reproduce, removed check
 * HOLD: bugs in spider's t2t()
         * once segfaulted on large column
         * sometimes doesn't work (ERR when it should be OK)
         Cannot reproduce
 * DONE: some input functions are in `x2y()` -- move them to `get_cmd()` (req.
         for mouse, hjkl modes)
 * DONE: sigint, sigcont handler! atexit() to avoid inconsistent term state
 * DONE: hjkl keyboard mode
 * DONE: more vim mode keys (first/last tableu)
 * DONE: online (key-)help `?`, `-h`, `-v` (NOTE: implemented -h, rest deemed
         not usedul)
 * DONE: extreme overlapping: if we are printing a sequence or multiple face down
	 cards, only print `.overlap` lines of the ends, and `1` line for the
         middle cards

## Notes

 - terminology:
```
    {stock}[waste]    [4*foundation]

    []   {}   {}   {}   {}   {}   {}
         []  (tableu piles)  {}   {}
              []   {}   {}   {}   {}
                   []   {}   {}   {}
                        []   {}   {}
                             []   {}
                                  []
```
 - data structures:
    - enum for each card (e.g. `SPADES_ACE`, `HEARTS_10`)
    - each pile is an array holding (13 open cards + up to 6 closed)    
      [0] is the "northmost"/bottom-most card; unoccupied are NULL/NO_CARD
    - a single card is represented in the 'cards' enum; if it is closed, it is negated.    
    - the foundation are 4 arrays of size 13
    - the stock pile is an array holding n cards and an index to the one to display
      when removing, decrement stack size and move all cards above index 1 over
    - previous states array: where to move which cards to get back to the state before    
    - undo:    
      double-linked list (follow `.prev` to undo, `.next` to redo)    
      "N cards were moved from X to Y" (do Y->X to undo)    
      allows jumping forwards in time as well (by repeating X->Y)    
      warn: when appending state, must check if `.next` was non-NULL and free rest of chain if so.
 - multiple card sizes: schemes.h will store cards like below. if we want to draw a card 
   that has one or more other cards below it, we only draw the first `.overlap` lines, 
   otherwise if it is the last one, we draw the whole one.
   this will give a look like in `~/solitaire-tests`
```
    .grid=7, /*vertical alignment*/
    .overlap=2,
    .cards = [
       ["â•­â”€â”€â”€â•®",
        "â”‚â™  Xâ”‚",
        "â”‚ â™  â”‚",
        "â•°â”€â”€â”€â•¯",
          NULL],
    ]
    /*or:*/
    .grid=2,
    .overlap=1,
    .cards = [
      [ "ðŸƒ– ", NULL ],
    ]
```
"open": face up card
"closed": face down card
